 COMPILING
---------------

	If you are not compiling DMM from the source, skip to the
	INSTALLATION section.

	I) On Windows

		a)	Build the Doom3 SDK library.

			1)	Copy the MSVC files release with DMM to the src/ subdirectory
				of your Doom3 SDK installation.
			2)	Open MSVC and open the project file Doom3sdk.dsw.
			3)	Set the active configuration to:
					gamex86_lib - Win32 Release
			4)	Open the file game/Game_local.cpp and change the line:
					extern "C" gameExport_t *GetGameAPI( gameImport_t *import ) {
				to
					gameExport_t *GetGameAPI( gameImport_t *import ) {
			5)	Build gamex86_lib
			6)	Copy the files from the SDK:
					src/Release/idlib.lib
					src/Release/gamex86_lib.lib
				to the directory above the DMM directory.
				That is, if this file is located at c:\dmm\dmm\README
				put the files in c:\dmm
			7)	Rename the gamex86_lib.lib file to gamex86.lib

		b)	Build DMM

			1)	Open the MSVC project file for DMM in the msvc\
					subdirectory.
			2)	Set the active configuration to:
					dmm - Win32 Release
			3)	Build dmm

		c)	Get all the files you compiled...

			1)	Copy the following files to a temporary directory
				of your choice:
				
				a)	msvc/Release/dmm.dll
				b)	pdb/msvc/Release/pdb.dll

	II) On Linux

		a)	Build the Doom3 SDK library.

			There is a nice guide to building the SDK at:
				http://wiki.doom3reference.com/wiki/Building_on_linux

			Otherwise...

				a)	Enter the src subdirectory
						# cd src/
				b	Invoke scons to build the SDK
						# scons CXX="g++-3.3" BUILD="release"
					Change "g++-3.3" to your GCC 3.3 binary if needed.
				c)	If you are building in a 64-bit environment you may need
					to modify the file SConstruct:
					i)	Around line 274, change the line:
						BASELINKFLAGS = [ ]
						to
						BASELINKFLAGS = [ "-m32" ]
					ii) Append to your scons command:
						BASEFLAGS="-m32"
				
		b)	Build DMM

			You can compile and install in one step,
			this is covered in the INSTALLATION section.
			Otherwise, you can compile without installing.

			Invoke the command:
				# make
			to build just the files, and nothing will be copied.

			Other build targets can be found with the command:
				# make help

---------------
 INSTALLATION
---------------

	I) On Windows

		1)	Make a directory called:
				dmm/
			In your Doom3 directory.

		2)	Copy to this directory the following files:
				pdb.dll
				dmm.conf

		3)	Run Doom3 then exit.
		4)	Copy the file gamex86.dll from the Doom3 directory
			to the dmm/ directory.
		5)	Copy the file:
				dmm.dll
			to your Doom3 directory and rename it to:
				gamex86.dll
		6)	Change gamex86.dll in your Doom3 directory to be read-only.
			To do this, right click on the file, select Properties,
			select "Read-Only", then apply.
		7)	Modify the file:
				dmm.conf
			as needed.

	II) On Linux

		To build and install DMM, execute the command:
			# make install

		The makefile will build DMM and copy it to the ~/.doom3/.dmm directory.
		If you do not have a .dmm/ directory, one will be created for you.

		Modify the file:
			dmm.conf
		as needed.

---------------
 RUNNING
---------------

	I) On Windows

		Create a shortcut with the path:
			"C:\doom3\doom3.exe"

		Where "C:\doom3\" is you doom3 installation directory.


	II) On Linux

		To run DMM, execute the command:
			# doom3

		If Doom3 is installed and accessable to you, the game will start and
		DMM will be automatically loaded.

		Remember, you must be in the "games" group to play Doom3.  See the Doom3
		installation directions for more information on setting up Doom3.
